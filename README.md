# Arduino Sensor-based Ruler + Drawing

The demo is an example of an Arduino sensor-based ruler that measures the distance in x coordinate. This example has been developed for the students enrolled in the "Designing Creative Support Tools" course at the University of Victoria (UVic). 

**List of components:**
  1. Arduino UNO [1pc]
  2. Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) [1pc] 
  3. Jumper Wires [4-5 pcs]
  4. USB cable to connect the Arduino [1pc]

**List of Software:**
  1. Arduino IDE
  2. Processing software
