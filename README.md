# Arduino-sensor-based-ruler

The demo is an example of an Arduino sensor-based ruler that measures the distance in x coordinate. This example has been developed for the students enrolled in the "Designing Creative Support Tools" course at the University of Victoria (UVic). We used Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), Jumper Wires, and Processing software.
